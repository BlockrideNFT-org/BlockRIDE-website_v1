            <p>
              We provide holders with easy access to important data and insights
              related to their ownership. From mileage, maintenance records and
              vehicle health to revenue and income reports, our dashboard puts
              all the essential information at your fingertips. With a
              user-friendly interface and real-time data, you can stay informed
              and make informed decisions about your fractional ownership of the
              bus.

              viable option for those who lack the capital to purchase a vehicle
              outright, and with our seamless and accessible platform, anyone
              can invest in fleet vehicles from anywhere and at any time without
              limitations.
